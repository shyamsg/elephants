# The mammoth elephant project
This project, a brain-child of Mikkel Sinding, is designed to use the publicly available datasets with
elephant and mammoth genomes, to find evidence (or lack thereof) of gene flow between the wolly mammoth
and the ancestor of the current asian elephants. Although, at the current time, we do not have very many
samples to look for this evidence, we are considering this an exploratory project, with further analyses
to follow in case we find evidence of such gene flow.

## Directory structure
Like most of my projects, this project has the directory structure with 3 subdirectories.
* code
All the code developed for this project is stored in files in this directory.
* data
This directory and subdirectories contain all the data used in this project. Due to the size of the data
sets being stored, this directory is _NOT SYNCED_ to github but will be made available when the paper is
published. 

## Samples & data storage
The samples in this project are almost all from publicly available sources. Here, I list the samples and
their sources.
